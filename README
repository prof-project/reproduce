install docker
install kurtosis 

1. Build the prof bundle merger (below is the non-sgx way to do it)
cd builder
docker build . -t prof-project/builder-prof-merger
cd ..

2. start up everything using kurtosis
first ensure that the prof relay code is located at ethereum-package/prof-relay  (i.e., inside the ethereum-package)
cd ethereum-package
kurtosis run --enclave prof ./ --args-file network_params.yaml

NOTE : use these exact names `builder-prof-merger` and `prof-relay` as that's what the above network params yaml looks for.
